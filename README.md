# Prisma Cloud DSPM Onboarding Template Example
This is an example of a Cloud Formation template generated from Prisma Cloud to onboard an account/project as Orchestrator, annd onboard an AWS/GCP Organization

Prisma Cloud DSPMâ€™s Orchestrator would be deployed in a specific account/project, where it comprises of compute resources responsible for scanning and analyzing monitored accounts. The cloud organization can then be onboarded to be handled by that specific orchestrator account/project.

If you plan to onboard an AWS/GCP organization, you will need to onboard one of the account/project as Orchestrator first.
